## Customized Feature extractors : 3D CNNS
<br><br>

### 0. Introduction
<br>
In computer vision, one of the most recent advances was video understanding. Video datasets usually has various length in time, and has strong correlation with nearby frames. Hence, 3D CNNs are the key models to tackle **Action Recognition** , one of the most important subtasks in video understanding.

Here, I introduce some major models and its variants to extract features from my task video dataset. Currently this repository supports C3D, R3D, and S3D.
